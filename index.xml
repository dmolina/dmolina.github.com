      <description>Two weeks ago I started my first teaching day, replacing a teacher that has still not gone to Ceuta (because the temporal contract was offered to many people, and all of them refuse it). Do not worry, they will have the material, I said to myself, na√Øvely.
However, my Phd. advisor, the coordinator of the course, has decided to replace the practice classes from Knime to Python using the different tools availables.</description>

      <description>All the source code of this post is available at github.
In the previous post, I recognized my predilection for Python. For me, it is a great language for create prototypes in many areas. For my research work, I usually creates/designs algorithms for continuous optimization using evolutionary algorithms. For these algorithms, languages like C/C++ or Java are widely used, specially for its good performance (to publish, it is usual to have to make many comparisons between algorithms, so the performance could be critical.</description>

      <title>Callback that stop algorithm in R</title>

      <description>Today I was making a little programming using the mathematical software R (very useful for statistics, by the way), for a little test.
I&amp;rsquo;m one of the authors of a Cran package (Rmalschains) for continuous optimization, and I was testing another packages to compare results.
Comparing a particular package I realise that the API doesn&amp;rsquo;t give me enough control for the comparisons. Briefly, to compare different algorithms all of them should stop when the same number of solutions is achieved.</description>
